# CrossRSS: Stateless CPU-aware datacenter load-balancing

This repository contains information/source code to perform the experiments done in [CrossRSS][crossrss-poster] published at [CoNEXT'20][conext20-page].

## Experiments

**Note that you have to setup your testbed based on [our guidelines](TESTBED.md) before running any experiment.**
The experiments all replay a trace through a load-balancer that dispatches packets to 4 virtual servers, that all have 4 cores. It therefore uses actually 17 cores.
Any trace should do, we used a campus one. Impact of the trace is discussed in length in the [RSS++ paper][rsspp-paper], our previous work.
NPF auto-generates the graph after running the experiments. The graphs in the poster are the one directly generated by NPF.

### Variance
The first experiment analyses the variance among server, and is generated using the first line of do\_graph.sh

### Throughput
The second experiment analyses the throughput the 4 servers of 4 cores can handle with the various load balancing techniques. It is generated by the second line of do\_graph.sh
